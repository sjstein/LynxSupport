Ip = 192.168.1.122
User = Administrator
Pw = Password
### NOTE: Ideally we will use a non-admin user/pw.
### at this time (June 2020) it seems that we cannot take control of a Lynx without using the 
### admin account.
###
### As of June, 2020 there is a user account named "aspuser" with password "nauticas2020" which will work
###   provided the system has been unlocked by the Administrator.
